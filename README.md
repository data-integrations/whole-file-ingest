Description
-----------
The whole file ingest plugins consist of sources and sinks that can copy data between different filesystems.

Use Case
--------
Use these plugins to create a pipeline that synchrnizes files in your local HDFS periodically with an Amazon S3 filesystem.
 
Build
-----
To build your plugins:

    mvn clean package -DskipTests

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

UI Integration
--------------
The CDAP UI displays each plugin property as a simple textbox. To customize how the plugin properties
are displayed in the UI, you can place a configuration file in the ``widgets`` directory.
The file must be named following a convention of ``[plugin-name]-[plugin-type].json``.

See [Plugin Widget Configuration](http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/hydrator-manual/developing-plugins/packaging-plugins.html#plugin-widget-json)
for details on the configuration file.

The UI will also display a reference doc for your plugin if you place a file in the ``docs`` directory
that follows the convention of ``[plugin-name]-[plugin-type].md``.

When the build runs, it will scan the ``widgets`` and ``docs`` directories in order to build an appropriately
formatted .json file under the ``target`` directory. This file is deployed along with your .jar file to add your
plugins to CDAP.

Deployment
----------
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/plugin.jar> config-file <target/plugin.json>

For example, here if your artifact is named 'azure-decompress-action-1.0.0.jar':

    > load artifact target/azure-decompress-action-1.0.0.jar config-file target/azure-decompress-action-1.0.0.json
