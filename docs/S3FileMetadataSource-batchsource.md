# S3 File Metadata Batch Source

Description
-----------
The S3 File Metadata plugin is a source plugin that allows users to read file metadata from an S3 Filesystem.


Use Case
--------
Use this source to extract the metadata of files under specified paths. The metadata can be passed to the
HDFSFileCopySink and the files will be copied from S3 to HDFS

| **Reference Name**     |  **Y**   | None      | This will be used to uniquely identify this source for lineage, annotating metadata, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Source Paths**       |  **Y**   | None      | Path(s) to file(s) to be read. If a directory is specified, terminate the path name with a '/'.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Max Split Size**     |  **Y**   | None      | Specifies the number of files that are controlled by each split. The number of splits created will be the total number of files divided by Max Split Size. The InputFormat will assign roughly the same number of bytes to each split.                                          |
| **Host URI**           |  **Y**   | None      | URI of the bucket which you want to read from.

| **Copy Recursively**   |  **Y**   | True      | Whether or not to copy recursively. Similar to the `-r` option in the `cp` terminal command. Set this to true if you want to copy the entire directory recursively.                                                                                                             |

Usage Notes
-----------
This source plugin only reads filemetadata from the source. To copy files, pass its outputs to a FileCopySink of the desired Filesystem.
A structured record with the following schema is emitted for each file it reads.
