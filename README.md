# Amazon S3 Client Action


Description
-----------
The Amazon S3 Client Action is used to work with S3 buckets and objects before or after the execution of a pipeline.

Use Case
--------
As a user, I need to copy files from a client's S3 bucket to my own S3 bucket in order to process it. I can use this action to do that.

Properties
----------
| Configuration | Required | Default | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :------ | :---------- |
| **Action** | **Y** | None | The action the plugin should perform. Based on this, different configuration options may be required. |
| **Amazon Access Key Id** | **Y** | None | The Amazon Access Key that has permission to perform the specified Action. |
| **Amazon Secret Key Id** | **Y** | None | The Amazon Secret Key that has permission to perform the specified Action. |
| **Region** | **Y** | None | The Amazon Region where the S3 action is to be performed. |
| **Source Bucket Name** | **For Copy Object Action** | None | The bucket where the file currently exists that you want to copy. |
| **Source Object Key** | **For Copy Object Action** | None | The object key to copy. If the file is in a folder, this includes the full path to the object. |
| **Destination Bucket Name** | **For Copy Object Action** | None | The bucket to copy the file to. |
| **Destination Object Key** | **For Copy Object Action** | None | The new object key of the file. If the file is in a folder, this is the full path to the new object. |
| **Bucket Name** | **For Create or Delete Bucket Action** | None | The name of the bucket to create or delete. |
| **New Bucket Macro Location** | **For Create Bucket Action** | None | The name of the macro that is to contain the new bucket name. This can be used in your pipeline if the name of the bucket is dynamic. |


Build
-----
To build your plugins:

    mvn clean package -DskipTests

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

UI Integration
--------------
The CDAP UI displays each plugin property as a simple textbox. To customize how the plugin properties
are displayed in the UI, you can place a configuration file in the ``widgets`` directory.
The file must be named following a convention of ``[plugin-name]-[plugin-type].json``.

See [Plugin Widget Configuration](http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/hydrator-manual/developing-plugins/packaging-plugins.html#plugin-widget-json)
for details on the configuration file.

The UI will also display a reference doc for your plugin if you place a file in the ``docs`` directory
that follows the convention of ``[plugin-name]-[plugin-type].md``.

When the build runs, it will scan the ``widgets`` and ``docs`` directories in order to build an appropriately
formatted .json file under the ``target`` directory. This file is deployed along with your .jar file to add your
plugins to CDAP.

Deployment
----------
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/plugin.jar> config-file <target/plugin.json>

For example, here if your artifact is named 'azure-decompress-action-1.0.0.jar':

    > load artifact target/azure-decompress-action-1.0.0.jar config-file target/azure-decompress-action-1.0.0.json
